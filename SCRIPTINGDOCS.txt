Basic documentation for the zenithra(.zen) scripting language

# All scripts shall be placed inside ./gamedata/scripts/ folder

# Entry script is entry.zen
# Other scripts from this entry script may be called like so:
call_script ./gamedata/scripts/script_name.zen
# When calling a script from entry.zen, every command will execute once, { terminates the script!!

# This is a comment

# Interpretor reads line by line
# Commands need to be seperated by new lines
# Every "part" of a command needs to be seperated by a space
# Commands need to strictly follow this convention
# A basic command will look like this
test_command param1 param2 ... -> output
# If any command is spelled incorrectly it will be ignored

# Variables will be registered like this
register_variable x value
# Each variable is of type float so integers work as well as floats
# Variables are shared across all scripts

# This is going to register a "callback"
# -> means value received from command will be outputed into variable
register_callback callback -> variable
# Callbacks are useful for pulling data/info from engine/game and then working with it in a script

# These are commands that execute only once on startup because they are placed before '{'
load_object ./gamedata/objects/plane.obj 0 -> obj_num
bind_texture_to_object obj_num ./gamedata/textures/gravel.DDS

# This represents a "loop"
# It is going to run with every frame
{
move_object obj_num x 0.01
}
# All commands outside of the loop below it will be ignored
# Commands outside of the loop above it will only be run through once on invoking the script

# List of currently supported commands:

register_variable variable_name initial_value
load_object path_to_object path_to_texture -> returns_object_array_identifier
bind_texture_to_object obj_num path_to_texture
move_object obj_num x/y/z value
call_script script_path
update_variable variable_x = value/variable_x (- + / *) value/variable_x

-------------------------------------------------------

-- Fix crashes when trying to load more than 2 objects

-- Fix incorrect object detection

-- Seperate error handling into a seperate source file and invest more time into it

-- Fix the focus loss logic in events - a bit clunky when holding escape

-- Add memory usage counter

-- Make objects scaleable

-- Make it so that incorrect composition in command in .zen files doesn't cause undefined behaviour (terminate command on \n)

-- Make it possible for objects to be loaded with preexisting textures

-- Create an editor
    -- Add object scaling function
    !-- Make the object interactable only after user clicks LMB
    	-- Make the arrows interactable with LMB and move the object

-- Create normal movement with collisions and gravity, and fly mode.. Maybe game's task ?

-- When loading an object, figure out which configuration of data is used and act accordingly!!!

-- In script files make it so NULL represents the value NULL

-- Fix incorrect object detection

-- Fix the focus loss logic in events - a bit clunky when holding escape

-- Add memory usage counter

-- Make it so that incorrect usage of command in .zen files doesn't cause undefined behaviour (terminate command on \n)

-- Make it possible for objects to be loaded with preexisting textures

-- Remove arrows pointing in different directions and rotate them in the engine

-- Create an editor
    -- Add object scaling function
    !-- Make the object interactable only after user clicks LMB
        -- Scale arrows to object so they're not absurdly large or small compared to selected object
    	-- Make the arrows interactable with LMB and move the object
